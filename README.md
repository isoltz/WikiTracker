# WikiTracker

This extension uses the Chrome Extensions API library to read through the users history and display recent Wikipedia pages viewed with hyperlinked page titles. For use, download, navigate to chrome://extensions/ in Chrome, click "load unpacked" and select the folder. Further information can be found on Chrome's lovely documentation pages: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted. I do not own the logo used; it can be found here http://communpedia.wikia.com/wiki/File:Wikipedia-W.png
