# WikiTracker

In the hopes helping myself retain at least some information gathered during Wikipedia binges, I made this extension which uses the Chrome Extensions API library to read through the users history and display hyperlinked page titles of recently visited Wikipedia pages. For use, download the repo, navigate to chrome://extensions/ in Chrome, click "load unpacked" and select the folder. Further information can be found on Chrome's lovely documentation pages: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted. I do not own the logo used; it can be found here http://communpedia.wikia.com/wiki/File:Wikipedia-W.png
